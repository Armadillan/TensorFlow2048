# Tensorflow2048
 
This was my project for Project Week Fall 2020 at The Putney School.

I'm using tf_agents to build a neural network using DDQN to solve the game 2048.

If you want to see an agent of mine in action, use `visualisation.py`.
It's also a good place to start if you want to look around the code.
I think it's pretty well commented.

Feel free to send me any questions at <antonikowalik23@gmail.com>
